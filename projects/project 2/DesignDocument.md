#Jack Kinne Project 2 - Cameras and Effects

Complete description and overview. This is where you describe in a brief, yet clear and concise, manner what your product should do and how you expect it should be used. Why did you write this application? What purpose does it serve? It's okay if the only purpose is to meet the homework requirement (but try to move bedyond just that - be creative!).




#Usage
In the first activity, we see a default image and two buttons.
The first button, "take picture" takes a picture with the camera.  You can view the results before you continue.  The second button, "edit Photo" takes you (and transfers the picture) to the second activity.

In the second activity we see the transfered photo, six switches with multiple image effects on the bottom of the screen, and two buttons.

apply any effects you wish by clicking the appropriate switch.  

It is possible to select and apply multiple effects at the same time--they are independently applied in a casscade from top to bottom.

press the "apply effects" button to apply.

If you wish to go back to a clean copy of hte photo, press the "revert changes" button.  All switches will revert to off, and the photo will be restored.



#System Design
the two buttons are: 
1. "apply effects" with apply any currently chosen switches.  
2. "revert changes" which returns the image to its original format.

Six switches are:
1. Highlight effect
2. Grayscale effect
3. Gamma effect
4. Sepia effect
5. Flip vertical
6. Flip horizontal

----------------------

//TODO: set switches back to off on pressing the revert changes button!!!!!!
