# Post Mortem - Jack Daniel Kinne P3

One particular struggle I overcame was getting the actual API to work on android studio.  Which let me tell you, is nothing like the code that was published for the rest of the class on Xamarin!

This particular challenge took the longest amount of time for this assignment -- and was filled with false starts.  I followed two different guides, both approximately a year old.  Low and behold, the codebase I was working from had been depreciated, and I found out the hard way.  Slowly.  I spent time on Google's developer console and spent time on the documentation directly.  That was a bit of a blackhole -- I ended up chasing minutiae and didn't get my target information.
Finally, after speaking with two seperate classmates I found some resources of an old google project and was able to get the api call working. 

Conversely, an issue I was unable to resolve was why the camera continued to crash on my new phone.  Which was pretty weird; because my second app, which I patterned the camera process from, works fine.  I threw several different solutions at the problem.  I checked out stack overflow.  Used breakpoints.  Followed tutorials.  Researched known issues.  Starred into the abyss, sacrificed a chicken.  And finally had to admit defeat.

If I could offer advice on this particular assignment; talk to your peers more often.  I probably could have been steared off some of the ledges I was walking on, had I spoken up more often about some of the deadends I had hit.  And i'm sure I could have helped them just as much, if not more.  

The most fun aspect of this assignment was by and far the results I got from google!  It was pretty fun seeing a computer accurately guess a picture, and list probabilities for each of the events.  That, and I delved much deeper into the UI aspect of development this cycle.  I am most proud of my UI on this assignment, because it doesn't look like hot garbage.  I used complimentary colors.  I rounded the corners on my buttons.  I matched padding.  I used a relative stretching layout. I forced a portrait layout.  I created a unique style theme and applied it to multiple objects.
When I was getting frustrated working on the backend, I'd take a break and spend time on the front, forcing me to spend a little bit more time on the actual GUI.

The most difficult aspect to understand for this project was almost certainly the API call to google.  It took quite a few hours to walk each section of code.  I can say with certainity that I now have a deeper understanding of that process.  

If I had a suggestion for how to improve this project in the future, I would say that breaking the class into ten minute discussion groups would have benefited me greatly -- checking in on what was working for us, what wasn't, what we were hung up on.  
Small group interactions are pretty critical for feedback, especially with tight deadlines and tough milestones.  Would this have helped everyone?  Maybe not.  But it would combat the feeling of struggling alone, foster better communication, and perhaps generate solutions.
